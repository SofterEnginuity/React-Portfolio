## How It's Made:
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, Express, MongoDB

1. Dark Mode Toggle
    - Implemented a button that allows users to switch between dark mode and light mode.
    - Used React's useState hook to manage the mode state.
    - Applied appropriate CSS classes to reflect the mode change.
2. Component Breakdown
    - Organized the project into multiple components.
    - Ensured proper folder structure (components/ for reusable components).


## Lessons Learned:
I built a new portfolio website using React with a dark mode and light mode toggle. This project helped me practice state management and component structuring while applying what I learned in parts 0 and 1 of FullStackOpen.


## Installation/Usage
1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`
3. run `node server.js`
4. Navigate to `localhost:5173`
